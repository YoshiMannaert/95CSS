# Cards

Cards and modals share the same styling and are made to look like Windows95 applications.

Cards can have a header with a card title as well as content inside the `card-body`

A simple card looks like this:
```html
<div class="card">
    <div class="card-header">
        <h2 class="card-title">Card #1</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet[]</p>
    </div>
</div>
```
