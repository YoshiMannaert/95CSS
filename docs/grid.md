# Grid

The 95CSS grid is based on the Bootstrap 4 grid and thus uses the same classes.

A basic grid setup would be something like:
```html
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm">
            One of three columns
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm">
            One of three columns
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm">
            One of three columns
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```
