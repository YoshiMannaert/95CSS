## About
95CSS is a simple CSS framework in the style of the Windows95 O.S.
While we try to get as close as possible to the original Windows95 styling, we have made changes and updates in some places to make it more useable for the modern screen.

## Getting started
To get started, you can use a CDN or import it in your CSS.

Via HTML:
```<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/95css@latest/css/95css.min.css" />```

Via CSS import
```@import "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/95css@latest/css/95css.min.css";```

## Styled components
At this moment, the following components have been styled

### Buttons
Including
- Default state
- Active state
- Focused state
- Disabled state
- Highlighted state (Think of this as a "primary" button)

### Inputs
- Text inputs
- Number inputs
- Checkboxes
- Radios
- Selects
  - Including [multiple]
- Range
- Color

### Dialogs
Comes in different sizes
Can be used for modals/popups as well as a card component

### Other
- Tabs
- Fieldsets
- Legends
- Dividers (`hr`'s)
- Progress bars
- Scrollbars

## Javascript
Currently, no JavaScript is included in the framework. While this may change in the future to enhance interactivity for certain components—such as tabs, modals, or dropdowns—or to enable more advanced styling, our focus is on providing robust CSS styles that make it easy for you to implement any necessary JavaScript yourself.

## Maintenance
This repository is being actively maintained. Please be aware that we are still in an early stage and any and all styling might change in the future. This includes breaking changes.
