# 95CSS
## A Windows 95 style CSS framework

95CSS is a simple CSS framework in the style of the Windows95 OS.

It uses both Bootstraps reboot and grid system but, even though a lot of class names are similar, it is NOT a Bootstrap theme.

Currently the only javascript that's part of this framework is [Micromodal.js](https://micromodal.now.sh). This is used to create WAI-ARIA guidelines compliant modals in a simple manner, but if wanted could be easily removed or switched with a different modal plugin.
